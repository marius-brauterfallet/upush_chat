# Upush Chat Client

A very basic, console based chat service written in C for the home exam assignment in the course IN2140. This delivery got the grade 'A'.

As was required by the assignment, I have also written a simple design document, explaining my choices when writing the program. All the source code is available, as it was handed in, and as such, some aspects of the program isn't working perfectly.
